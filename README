This is my take on solving the awkward relationship between 
Django Templates and Metatag/title information.

My approach staunchly defends user simplicity. The down-side (if you 
want to call it that) is that there is template logic in the admin. 

INSTALL:

1) Blah blah blah INSTALLED_APPS, Syncdb.

2) Add some URLMetatags model instances

3) Load the "metatag_tags" templatetag in your base tag and call {% metatag_populate %}
